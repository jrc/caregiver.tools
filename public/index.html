                This page is a guide of free digital tools to help individuals
                with dementia and their caregivers. We prefer free tools with no

            <h2><a href="dayclock/">Dementia Day Clock</a></h2>
            <p>
                Dementia Day Clock is a free web app that shows the day, time,
                and date in a way that’s easy to understand for people with
                cognitive disabilities. It’s also specifically designed to work
                on older phones and tablets, giving new life to unused devices.
                Caregivers can remotely set a custom message to be displayed on
                the clock.

                If the person with dementia has a newer iPhone or iPad device

            <p>
                Apple makes a small tracking device called <b>AirTag</b>, useful
                for finding commonly misplaced items like keys, a purse, or even
                a remote control. Simply attach an AirTag to an item, and then
                use an iPhone or iPad to show its location or make the AirTag
                play a sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                AirTag requires an iPhone or iPad with iOS/iPadOS 14.5 or later.
                This means that
                <a href="https://iosref.com/ios"
