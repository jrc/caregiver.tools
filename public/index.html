            <p>
                Dementia Day Clock is a free web app that shows the day, time,
                and date in a way that’s easy to understand for people with
                cognitive disabilities. It’s also specifically designed to work
                on older phones and tablets, giving new life to unused devices.
                Caregivers can remotely set a custom text message to be
                displayed on the clock.
